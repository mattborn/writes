While researching the quickest way to get a new Jekyll blog up and running, I came across several tools and tutorials detailing exactly what I was looking for (see references below). As I began to dig into each one, however, I was bothered by unnecessary features, files, semantics, etc. [Sturgeon’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) in full effect. So I decided to write this, my own tutorial on using vanilla [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and [Prose.io](http://prose.io) to quickly create, host, and manage a static site for free … AKA Best Blog Ever.

These instructions are for Terminal on a Mac.

## Vanilla Jekyll

First, we need a non-system version of Ruby and the same version of Jekyll that GitHub uses.

[Complete the first 4 steps here](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/#basic-github-checkout) to install rbenv.

Next, `git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build && rbenv install 2.2.3 && rbenv global 2.2.3`.

You now have Ruby.

In a new terminal tab, `gem install bundler && echo -e "source 'https://rubygems.org'\ngem 'github-pages'" >> Gemfile && bundle install`.

You now have Jekyll.

Start a new Jekyll project with `jekyll new project-name` where `project-name` is name of your project. This will generate all the files and folders Jekyll needs to build your site.

Test to see if everything worked with `cd project-name && jekyll serve`. In a new terminal tab, `open http://localhost:4000`. We needed a new tab because `jekyll serve` is a blocking process that will continue running until you cancel it with `Ctrl+C`.

## GitHub Pages

Now we need to turn our vanilla Jekyll project into a git repo and push it up to GitHub. If you haven’t already, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and [configure your SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).

Create a new repo on GitHub, and **do not** initialize with a README. On the right side of the next screen, copy the SSH clone URL that looks like `git@github.com:username/project-name.git`.

From our Jekyll project directory, `git init && git add . && git commit -m 'Install vanilla Jekyll' && git remote add origin PASTE_HERE && git branch -m gh-pages && git push -u origin gh-pages` where `PASTE_HERE` is the SSH clone URL you just copied.

You just deployed your site.

In the background, GitHub is running the Jekyll build process to compile and serve your site. After about 10-30 seconds, your site should be available at `http://username.github.io/project-name`.

If you want to push to your `username.github.io` instead of a project page, the previous command should be `git init && git add . && git commit -m 'Install vanilla Jekyll' && git remote add origin PASTE_HERE && git push -u origin master`.

## Prose.io

Ok, we now have our vanilla Jekyll project hosted on GitHub. It’s time to introduce our clever content management system.

`open http://prose.io`, then click through to **Authorize on GitHub**.

Now `open http://prose.io/#username/project-name`. You should see your Jekyll project files and folders. Click **_posts**, then click **New File**.

Use the [markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github) editor to create a new post and format it however you’d like. Click the **disk icon** on the right, then click **Submit Change Request**.

Boom. That’s it!

You can follow this same workflow indefinitely to create new files and edit existing ones to build up your site content.

## Now What?

At this point, you may be wondering how to use something other than the default template or how to add commenting or analytics. I will write about these things as I get to them myself, but for now, I will recommend some good starting points:

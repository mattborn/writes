# Web Designer & Mentor

Hey, my name’s Matt and I live in Chicago with my wife Megan & daughter Maely. I started creating for the web 17 years ago and I never stopped. This site showcases both my work and the resources I am actively creating to help other designers & developers grow. Let’s grab a beer sometime. Cheers!
